            Welcome to HomeHarmony!
        </p>
        <p>
            HomeHarmony is a web application that sends duty reminders to your roommates! 
            It can also be used by people living in the same household such as a family.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to use the app: enter each roommate's name, email address
            and phone number in the Create Roommate Section, then create duties in the Create Duties Section.
            Each roommate and duty will then appear in the Assign Duties here section, from there you can assign each duty to 
            whomever you want to. 
        </p>
